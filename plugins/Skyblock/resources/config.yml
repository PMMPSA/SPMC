# It is not recommended that you manually edit this. Leave this to the plugin!
# Changing this could stop the plugin from working correctly.
SkyBlockWorld Base Name: false

# You can set the SkyBlock worlds that the plugin will use in your server by changing this variable.
# It is not recommended to change this in the config.yml.
# It is safer to change this by doing /is setworld in-game.
# The plugin will not function if you manually change this to an incorrect value.
SkyBlockWorlds: []

# The Interval is the distance between each Island.
# A recommended Interval is between 200-700. 500 is standard SkyBlock.
# Any farther is useless, and any less will result in a very crowded skyblock world.
Interval: 500

# The magic cobblestone generator is automatically enabled when you first start up the plugin.
# When enabled cobblestone generators will generate much more than just cobblestone.
# When disabled cobblestone generators will function normally.
CobbleGen: true

# You can edit the below values to change what the magic cobblestone generator spawns.
# Just follow the format shown below: id:percent
# id is the id of the block you would like to appear
# percent is the percent chance out of 100 that the item will appear.
# The percents MUST have a sum of 100, otherwise the spawner will only spawn cobblestone.

#The Starting Items are the items in SkyBlock that a player will recieve when they first generate their island.
#These items can be edited in the config here. It is really simple and follows this format: "id, damage, count"
#id is the item id for an item in Minecraft, for example: stone's id is 1
#damage is the data value which cooresponds with each individual id. For example: Red wool would have the id 35 and the damage 14
#count is pretty simple. It is the amount of each item that the player will recieve. It is NOT recommended to set this number super high.

  - 79, 0, 2

# There are two values for hunger: on and off. If hunger is off then players will no longer loose hunger
# while they are in the SkyBlock world.
Hunger: true

# There are two values for void: on and off. If void is off then players who fall in the void will not die
# while they are in the SkyBlock world.
Void: true

# There are two values for PVP: on and off. If PVP is off then players will not be able to PVP

# There are two values for keep inventory: on and off. If it is on then players who die will not
# lose the items in their inventory.
KeepInventory: false

# This limits the amount of members a player can have on their island. Set the number to 0 to disable
# member limits. The default is a 3 member limit.
MemberLimit: 3

# This is the initial island size for a player when they first generate their island. This amount is
# equal to the length and width of a player's available island space.
# For example: Making this number 100 would give each new player 100x100 available space for their island.
Island Size: 100

# These are the blocks that increase island value when placed. It follows this format: "id: value"
# Id is the item id for an item in Minecraft, for example: stone's id is 1.
# Value is the amount by which a player's island worth increases each time they place a block in this array.
# For reference, by default, when a player places a diamond block on their island, their island's value increase by 5
# You can have add as many block-value pairs to this array, just follow the format as shown below.
Valuable Blocks:
  57: 5
  41: 4
  42: 3
  152: 2
  22: 2
  173: 1

# This is the amount of islands that can be generated in a world before a new world is created.
# The amount of islands allowed in a world should be inverse to your interval.
# So, if you have a high interval then you should make this number smaller.
# And if you have a low interval make this number bigger.
# Recommended world island limit is 80.
World Island Limit: 80

# This is the cooldown (in seconds) that a player must wait before using the /is reset command again.
# You can disable the reset cooldown by setting this value to 0. 86400 is one day.
Reset Cooldown: 86400

# If void is disabled and this is true then players who fall in the void will be teleported back
# To their island spawn points. If this is false then they will be teleported to the server spawn.
Island Spawn: true

# If this is true players who are visiting other islands can not take damage.
# If this is false players who are visiting will take damage normally.
Invincible Visitors: false

# This is the maximum amount of characters allowed in a player's island name.

# Set this to false if you would like to disable the built-in RedSkyBlock challenges feature.
# Leave this enabled if you would like to use the built-in RedSkyBlock challenges feature.
